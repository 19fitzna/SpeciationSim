Title: Natural Selection Sim
Desc: Simulation of fish undergoing speciation due to differences in predation across two environments

Concept:
- Have red fish (predators) and light blue/grey fish (prey)
- Space will be split into two background types: Blue and white
- Light blue fish will have lower chance of being eaten on blue spaces
- Grey fish will have lower chance of being eaten on white spaces
- Prey fish will have 2 alleles for color
- Blue coloration will be dominant
- Every fish will have 2 parents and inheret genes for coloration
- Blue will be dominant allele
- (Might want to display heterzygous fish as another color)
- If/when alleles are driven to fixation for each environment type, how much interbreeding takes place?


TODO:
- Add different backgrounds/environments
- Have Changing selection factors for each environment
- offspring should spawn at parent location

Roadmap:
1. Get fish to breed, and be able to determine specific parents                       DONE
2. Pass alleles from parent to offspring                                              DONE
3. Add regions with different levels of predation for different colored fish          
4. Track number of heterozygous fish
